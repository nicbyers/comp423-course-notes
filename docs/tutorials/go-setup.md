## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:
- **Docker**: To run the development container.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The editor you'll use to write your Go code.
- **Dev Containers extension for VS Code**: This allows you to work inside a containerized environment with all necessary tools pre-installed.

## Steps for setting up the DevContainer:

### 1. **Create a new directory**
Start by creating a new directory for your Go project and navigating to it in your terminal:

**mkdir go-dev-container**
**cd go-dev-container**
